    Analyze the following list of real estate news article titles and summaries. Your task is to perform a detailed thematic analysis and output the results in a valid JSON format.

    1. Identify the top 5 most prominent main themes.
    2. For each main theme, provide a concise name.
    3. **For each main theme, also identify 2-3 specific sub-themes.**
    4. For each main theme, calculate the percentage of articles that discuss it and provide a number.
    5. For each main theme, list the unique IDs and hyperlinks of the articles that correspond to it.
    
    **Output MUST be in this strict JSON format, including the 'sub_themes' array:**
